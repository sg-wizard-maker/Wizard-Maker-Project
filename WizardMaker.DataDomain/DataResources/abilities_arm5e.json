    "Type": "Ability",
    "Data": {
      "Description": "The seven artes liberales, or liberal arts, are the basis of medieval higher education. Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.\nThe artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)\nGrammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his logica vetus and logica nova. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his De Inventione.\nArithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, De arithmetica. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his Elementa. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's Optica is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the Libri Almagesti. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in De Musica.\nArtes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.\nSpecialties: grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

      "Description": "Civil Law is the law of the Roman Empire. Most local legal systems are based upon it (England being the notable exception), and when a law is needed to govern international relations, Civil Law is appealed to. The authority is Justinian's Digest. Canon Law is the law of the Church. It is important to Mythic Europe as it applies in all nations, governing the working of the church and some other areas, such as marriage. It is important to note that members of the clergy are only subject to Canon Law, not customary or Civil Law. Most high churchmen are skilled canonists, not theologians. Canon Law is made by Papal bulls (pronouncements), but the authority is Gratian, in his Decretum. This skill covers the knowledge of both types of law. Other religions, particularly Judaism and Islam, have their own versions of this Ability, which must be learned separately.\nSpecialties: laws and customs of a specific area, papal laws. (Academic)",

Medicine also deals with treating poisons and the results of starvation and the like, but not with treating wounds (see \"Chirurgy,\" above).

It roughly corresponds to today�s science. The main texts are the Physica, De Meteorologia, and De historia animalium. Moral philosophy is the study of the proper way of human life. It covers ethics, politics, and economics � the texts are the Ethica, Politica, and Economica. Metaphysics is the philosophy of the fundamental nature of the world. The main text is Aristotle�s Metaphysica. Specialties: natural philosophy, moral philosophy, metaphysics, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic. (Academic) Source: Ars Magica Fifth Edition, p.66",

    "Data": {
      "Description": "(Mystery Cult) Lore is the (Organization) Lore of a particular cult. It provides knowledge of the legends, history, structure, operation, and goals of the Mystery Cult in question. It includes knowledge of the magics, rites, and secret passwords and symbolism of the cult, how to covertly signal membership, and how to assess another magus&rsquo;s membership or non-membership in the cult. Two magi with this Ability for the same Mystery Cult may well be able to hold a seemingly innocuous conversation without outsiders realizing that a second, secret, conversation is hidden within the innocent phrases. In order to prevent outsiders from learning secrets of the Mystery, many Mystery Cults&rsquo; specialty books require a score in this Ability for a magus to decode their symbolism. (Mystery Cult) Lore also covers the ceremonies of the cult, frequently enacted when the cult members gather formally. It is a key knowledge for a Mystagogue&rsquo;s performance of the Initiation rites, to guide the Initiate through Ordeals, ceremonies, and meditations to gain new Virtues.\nKnowledge of this Ability is passed from Mystagogue to Initiate, from mystae to mystae, in a chain of living secrets. Some cults also write down their secret lore, as this codifies the Mystery and lets others share the same view of the cult. Others prefer the secrecy of an oral tradition. Small cults may fade away from lack of members, especially if they are persecuted, but if they have committed some of their lore to writing, the cults may be restarted by those who discover and understand the texts. Some cults risk the loss of secrecy for this very reason: so that their secrets and magical rites may not be lost forever. Some magi search for lost texts, containing secret lore of the ancients, hoping to re-enact the rites and rituals that led them to power.\nIn game terms, experience points in (Mystery Cult) Lore can be acquired like any other knowledge, including through teaching, books, practice, and exposure. Learning (Mystery Cult) Lore from another ensures that master and pupil share the same rites; learning in isolation may lead to variant (or even deviant) rites and rituals &mdash; from such discrepancies schisms sometimes arise, and cults may break up and fragment.\nA magus may build his (Mystery Cult) Lore from zero, even without instruction, but this means he has devised his own cult, and should treat his Lore as an entirely new (Mystery Cult) Lore.",

      "Description": "You have the ability to find things nearby through the use of a dowsing rod (usually a forked stick) and your own intuitive sense. You concentrate on the thing to be found, hold your dowsing rod out in front of you, and follow its subtle motions to the target. If you're looking for something specific, you must have an appropriate sympathetic connection to the thing sought (such as bottled water from a stream when searching for running water). Before you roll, designate the area in which you are searching - if the item sought is not present in that area, you automatically fail. The time required to search depends on the size of the area, and must be invested whether you succeed or not. It takes about one Diameter (two minutes, or twenty combat rounds) to search for something within 25 paces, and doubling the distance quadruples the time. To find something common, like water, within 25 paces requires a Perception + Dowsing of 9+. Increased distances or dowsing for less common things increases the target number, so that, for example, finding gold within 100 paces would have an Ease Factor of 15.\nSpecialties: searching for a particular kind of thing (water, gold, etc.), searching in a particular kind of place.

You should also roll for the quality of the musical performance, but the magical effect is independent of this, unless you botch. If you do botch the Music roll, you have failed to produce any music for some reason, and so the Supernatural Ability automatically fails.\nSpecialties: a particular emotion, a particular sort of person.

      "Description": "Bjornaer magi can take the form of a single;mundane creature. This is usually an animal;or bird, but it can be a plant. The heartbeast is;always a living thing, and usually a noble creature.;No known magus has had an earthworm;heartbeast, for example. A maga&rsquo;s heartbeast displays a central aspect of her nature, so that her personality, even in human form, will;resemble that of the creature. Initiates of the;Bjornaer mystery gain the Ability Heartbeast.;This Ability cannot be gained by any character;who has not been initiated into the mystery. For initiates of the Outer Mystery, the;Heartbeast Ability is only used when something;tries to stop the magus changing forms.;In that case, a roll of Stamina + Heartbeast;against an Ease Factor set by the storyguide;allows the character to change anyway.\nA Bjornaer maga can only change into;one kind of animal, and that kind cannot be;altered by Hermetic magic. The transformed Bjornaer can be changed, by Muto Animal magic, for example, but the kind of animal that;her heartbeast is cannot be changed. A Bjornaer maga really is her heartbeast, and so remaining in that form does not count as being;under an active mystical effect (see &ldquo;Warping,&ldquo;;page 167). Of course, she is really human as;well, so remaining human does not cause warping;either. Hermetic magic is unable to tell whether an animal is actually a Bjornaer, and;the same applies to most other kinds of magic.;(This assumes that the maga is trying to hide;her nature, of course.) As a result, a Bjornaer in;animal form is affected by Animal spells, not;Corpus or Mentem spells. Spells already in;effect before the transformation remain in;effect, however.\nBjornaer magi can cast spells while in the;form of their heartbeast, but they cannot speak;or make the appropriate gestures, and thus normally;take a &ndash;15 penalty.\nThe transformation takes only a moment,;and affects only the maga. None of her possessions are transformed. A Bjornaer who has been;physically changed by magic may try to assume;her normal form or her heartbeast form. She;must roll Stamina + Heartbeast against an Ease;Factor set by the storyguide. As a rule of;thumb, 3 + the magnitude of the transforming magic is a reasonable number. If she does;resume one of her natural forms, the other;magic is dispelled.\nBjornaer magi do not treat physical transformations;as major magical effects for the purposes;of gaining Warping Points. However, a;magical transformation which is maintained;over time will grant one Warping Point per;year, as it is still a continuing mystical effect.\nFinally, Bjornaer magi cannot bind familiars.;The reasons for this are debated, but the;fact is uncontroversial.",
